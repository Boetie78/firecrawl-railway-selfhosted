# Deploying Firecrawl to Your Existing Railway Project

## Your Railway Project
**Project URL:** https://railway.com/project/f4cba472-90a4-414d-90c5-657e13b78c7a  
**Environment:** Production (3a6358ad-4cd7-40bf-937d-97c4e54762d9)

## Quick Deployment to Existing Project

### Option 1: Automated Script (Recommended)
```bash
cd ~/firecrawl
./deploy-to-existing-railway.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Steps

1. **Link to your project:**
   ```bash
   cd ~/firecrawl
   railway link
   # Select your project when prompted
   ```

2. **Check current services:**
   ```bash
   railway status
   railway service list
   ```

3. **Deploy Firecrawl services:**
   ```bash
   railway up --detach
   ```

4. **Get your API URL:**
   ```bash
   railway url --service api
   ```

5. **Test deployment:**
   ```bash
   ./test-firecrawl.sh $(railway url --service api)
   ```

## What Will Be Added to Your Project

The deployment will add these services to your existing Railway project:

- **üî• api** - Main Firecrawl API server
- **üë∑ worker** - Background job processor  
- **üé≠ playwright-service** - Web scraping engine
- **üóÑÔ∏è redis** - Queue and cache storage

## Integration with Existing Services

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ All services in one project (easier management)
- ‚úÖ Shared networking (services can communicate)
- ‚úÖ Centralized billing and monitoring
- ‚úÖ Environment variable sharing

**Considerations:**
- Your existing services will remain unchanged
- Firecrawl services will be added alongside current ones
- You can manage all services from the same dashboard

## Environment Configuration

Your Firecrawl deployment will use these settings:

```bash
# Core settings
PORT=3002
HOST=0.0.0.0
USE_DB_AUTHENTICATION=false

# Admin access (CHANGE THIS!)
BULL_AUTH_KEY=firecrawl-railway-2024

# Optional: Add OpenAI integration
# railway env set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

## After Deployment

1. **Get your Firecrawl URL:**
   ```bash
   railway url --service api
   ```
   Should return something like: `https://api-production-xyz.up.railway.app`

2. **Access admin panel:**
   ```
   https://your-api-url/admin/firecrawl-railway-2024/queues
   ```

3. **Update local MCP configuration:**
   - Edit your MCP config file
   - Change Firecrawl base URL to your Railway URL
   - Restart MCP client

4. **Test everything works:**
   ```bash
   ./test-firecrawl.sh https://your-api-url.railway.app
   ```

## Cost Considerations

**Current Setup Impact:**
- Firecrawl will add ~4 services to your project
- Railway bills by total project usage
- Development usage: ~$10-20/month additional
- Production scaling: Based on actual usage

**vs Alternatives:**
- Much cheaper than per-API-call services
- Full control and customization
- No external dependencies

## Troubleshooting

**Deployment Issues:**
```bash
# Check service status
railway status

# View logs
railway logs --service api

# Restart services if needed
railway restart --service api
```

**MCP Connection Issues:**
- Ensure Railway URL is accessible
- Check MCP configuration syntax
- Test Railway API with curl first
- Restart MCP client after changes

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Run the deployment script
2. ‚úÖ Get your API URL  
3. ‚úÖ Update MCP configuration
4. ‚úÖ Test Firecrawl MCP functions
5. ‚úÖ Start building with full Firecrawl features!
